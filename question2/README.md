## Question 2

Write the logic of the lower function (from K&R pg. 43) in main, which converts upper case letters to lower case, with a condition expression instead of if-else. Provide an example to demonstrate your logic. (K&R Exercise 2-10) 

Output:

When user input (c) = A
the computer will add the difference in ASCII numbers of captial and lowercase and add the difference to the input, then the computer will translate that to a letter.
That way the computers output will be a.

If the letter is not between A and Z, it is not captial, and the computer will print that the input (c) is not a capital letter.
