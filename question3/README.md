## Question 3

Write a program that bitshifts an int x left by 2 if it is less than 4 and right shifts x by 2 if it is greater than or equal to 8. Print the final result. If it lies in between, just print the same number. Do this for x=3, x=5, and x=10.

Output:
when i=3, bitshift results = 12
when i=5, bitshift results = 5
when i=10, bitshift results =2
